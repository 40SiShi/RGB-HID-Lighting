# Arduino HID Lighting

Some games (eg Konami arcade rips) support external lights, controlled by the game.
These communicate over generic HID output reports.

This is a small project that configures USB capable Arduino boards correctly,
such that you only need to handle LED events.

If there are any compatibility problems, pull requests and new issues are most welcome.
