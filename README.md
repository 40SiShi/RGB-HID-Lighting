# SoundVoltex-Lighting-v2 

Forked from https://github.com/mon/Arduino-HID-Lighting, thanks!

Second version of my SoundVoltex LED lighting. This version will feature multiple locations and easy setup.

Proposed usages:  
* 7 standard keys (A, B, C, D, FX-L, FX-R, Start)
* 5 RGB lights (4 wings, 1 woofer)
